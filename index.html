<p>Hold me close and hold me fast. 
  The magic spell you cast. 
  This is <strong>la vie en rose.</strong> 
  When you kiss me, heaven sighs. 
  And though I close my eyes, I see <strong>la vie en rose.</strong>
  When you press me to your heart, I'm in a world apart. A world where roses bloom.
  And when you speak, angels sing from above.
  Everyday words seem to turn into love songs.
  Give your heart and soul to me, and life will always be <strong>la vie en rose.</strong></p>
